⭐ Why Computers Prefer Standardized Values?
✔ Matrix multiplication becomes faster

Numbers between -1 and 1 are easier to compute.

✔ Fewer memory problems

Large numbers cause computational instability.

✔ Better numerical precision

Floating-point calculations become more accurate.




✅ Q1. Standardize the array [2, 4, 6, 8]
mean = (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) / 4 = 20/4 = 5

Step 2: Standard Deviation

Values from mean:

2 → -3
4 → -1
6 → +1
8 → +3


Square them:

9, 1, 1, 9


Mean of squares:

(9 + 1 + 1 + 9) / 4 = 20/4 = 5


Std = √5
≈ 2.236
Formula:

z = (x - mean) / std


For each value:

x	(x-5)/2.236	result
2	-3/2.236	-1.34
4	-1/2.236	-0.45
6	1/2.236	+0.45
8	3/2.236	+1.34
✔ Final Answer:
[-1.34, -0.45, 0.45, 1.34]

✅ Q3. Why do we standardize before training a neural network?
✔ Answer:

Because neural networks learn using gradient descent, and standardization makes the learning faster, stable, and prevents one feature from dominating others.

✅ Q4. Which will dominate KNN — Age or Salary?
Feature	Range
Age	20–50
Salary	20,000–80,000
✔ Salary will dominate.

Because its values are much larger, so distance calculations become unfair.

KNN will think salary is more important (even if it’s not).

✅ Q5. After standardization, the mean and std become?

Always:

Metric	Value
Mean	0
Standard deviation	1

That’s the purpose of standardization.
