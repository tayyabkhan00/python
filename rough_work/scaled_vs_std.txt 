✅ Similarity

Both scaled and standardized data have the same purpose:

👉 Make features comparable
👉 Remove unit/scale differences
👉 Help ML models work better

Example: Height (cm) and Salary (₹) can be brought to similar scale.

✅ Difference (Real-World Meaning)
1️⃣ Min-Max Scaling (0–1 scaling)
scaled = (x - min) / (max - min)

Real-world meaning:

✔ Converts values into a percentage-like form
✔ 0 = minimum value in data
✔ 1 = maximum value in data
✔ Everything else falls between 0 and 1

Use when:
👉 Data is bounded (marks, speed limits, age, etc.)
👉 You want values in strict 0–1 range

Not good for:
❌ Outliers (they stretch the scale)

2️⃣ Standardization (Z-score normalization)
std = (x - mean) / std

Real-world meaning:

✔ Converts values into how many standard deviations away from mean
✔ Data becomes centered at 0
✔ Spread becomes 1

Interpretation:

0 = average

+1 = one std above average

-1 = one std below average

Use when:
👉 Data has normal/near-normal distribution
👉 Models assume Gaussian data (ML, statistics)
👉 Data has outliers → less distortion than min-max

🎯 Super-short summary
Method	Real-world meaning	Best for
Scaled (0–1)	Percentage form	Bounded values, neural nets
Standardized (Z-score)	How far from average	Stats, ML models, outliers
