# Data Analyst LeetCode Practice Roadmap

This roadmap covers essential SQL and Python (Pandas) problems commonly asked in Data Analyst interviews, progressing from basic to advanced concepts.

## 🟢 Basic (Foundations)
Focus: Basic syntax, filtering, and simple data manipulation.

### SQL
1.  **Big Countries** (Select, Where)
    -   *Concept*: Filtering rows based on conditions.
2.  **Recyclable and Low Fat Products** (Select, Where, Enums)
    -   *Concept*: Simple boolean logic.
3.  **Invalid Tweets** (Length check)
    -   *Concept*: String length functions.
4.  **Article Views I** (Distinct, Sorting)
    -   *Concept*: Removing duplicates and sorting results.

### Python (Pandas)
1.  **Create a DataFrame from List**
    -   *Concept*: DataFrame construction.
2.  **Get Size of DataFrame**
    -   *Concept*: Shape attribute.
3.  **Display the First 3 Rows**
    -   *Concept*: Head method.
4.  **Select Data**
    -   *Concept*: Selecting columns and rows.

## 🟡 Intermediate (Aggregations & Joins)
Focus: Grouping data, joining tables, and handling nulls.

### SQL
1.  **Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier** (Left Join)
    -   *Concept*: Basic joins.
2.  **Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions** (Left Join, Null check)
    -   *Concept*: Finding missing matches.
3.  **Rising Temperature** (Self Join, Date functions)
    -   *Concept*: Comparing rows within the same table.
4.  **Average Time of Process per Machine** (Group By, Aggregation)
    -   *Concept*: Calculating averages per group.

### Python (Pandas)
1.  **Drop Duplicate Rows**
    -   *Concept*: Cleaning data.
2.  **Drop Missing Data**
    -   *Concept*: Handling NaNs.
3.  **Modify Columns**
    -   *Concept*: Applying functions to columns.
4.  **Rename Columns**
    -   *Concept*: Renaming for clarity.

## 🔴 Advanced (Window Functions & Complex Logic)
Focus: Ranking, running totals, CTEs, and complex subqueries.

### SQL
1.  **Nth Highest Salary** (Limit/Offset or Dense Rank)
    -   *Concept*: Ranking data.
2.  **Rank Scores** (Window Functions)
    -   *Concept*: `DENSE_RANK()`, `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`.
3.  **Department Top Three Salaries** (Window Functions, Partition By)
    -   *Concept*: Advanced ranking within groups.
4.  **Human Traffic of Stadium** (Complex filtering, gaps and islands)
    -   *Concept*: Identifying consecutive sequences.

### Python (Pandas)
1.  **Reshape Data: Concatenate**
    -   *Concept*: Combining DataFrames.
2.  **Reshape Data: Pivot**
    -   *Concept*: Reshaping from long to wide format.
3.  **Reshape Data: Melt**
    -   *Concept*: Reshaping from wide to long format.
4.  **Method Chaining**
    -   *Concept*: Writing clean, readable transformation pipelines.
