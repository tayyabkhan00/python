**⭐ If outcome is a number, linear regression is used.**

📏 The Math (very simple)
Linear regression equation:
y = m × x + b
m = slope (how steep the line is)
b = intercept (where line starts)
x = input
y = predicted value
But don’t worry — sklearn calculates m and b automatically.

⭐ Key Terms (explained very easy):
Training → feeding data to learn the best line
Model → the line created
Prediction → using the line to guess new values
Loss/Error → how far prediction is from real value
R² score → how good the line is (0 to 1)

🎯 Cost Function (Mean Squared Error):
This measures how bad the line is.
MSE = average of (predicted – actual)²
Why squared?
Because negative errors should not cancel positive ones.
Goal: Make error as small as possible.

🎯 Gradient Descent (How the model learns m and b):
Think of a ball rolling down a hill.
Ball = algorithm
Hill = error
Bottom = best values of m & b
Gradient descent updates:
m = m – learning_rate × derivative
b = b – learning_rate × derivative
This slowly finds the optimal slope & intercept.
➡️ You don’t manually do this.
sklearn does it for you.

🎯 ⭐ Final Summary:
Linear Regression is:
✔ simplest ML model
✔ used to predict numbers
✔ finds best straight line
✔ uses MSE + Gradient Descent
✔ easy to implement and interpret
✔ perfect first ML algorithm
