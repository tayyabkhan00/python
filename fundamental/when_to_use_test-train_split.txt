| Situation                                  | Do we use train-test split? | Why?                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Teaching concept**                       | ❌ No                        | Keep examples simple |
| **Real ML project**                        | ✔ Yes                       | Evaluate accuracy    |
| **Tiny dataset (4–6 rows)**                | ❌ No                        | Insufficient data    |
| **Large dataset (100+ rows)**              | ✔ Yes                       | Prevent overfitting  |
| **Kaggle / freelancing / college project** | ✔ Yes                       | Mandatory            |


⭐ Should you always use train-test split?
YES — when building real ML models.
Only skip it when:
doing a small explanation
showing algorithm working
dataset is extremely 

⭐ Why we usually use train-test split for ML?
Because:
✔ It prevents overfitting
✔ It checks model performance on new data
✔ It tells if the model will work in real life
✔ It gives accuracy, R² score, etc.
95% of ML projects MUST use train-test split.

⭐ What is Train-Test Split?
Imagine you are studying for an exam.
Training data → the chapters you study
Testing data → the questions you haven't seen before
Why do we test on unseen data?
👉 To check how well you actually learned.
Same for ML.
