🧠 In LSTM, we have TWO types of memory

h_t → Hidden state (short-term memory)
c_t → Cell state (long-term memory)
Both are updated at every timestep.

⭐ Is hₙ the previous or recent memory?
h_n = the final hidden state after the last time step.
It represents:
short-term memory
what LSTM wants to “output” at each step
So hₙ = recent (latest) memory.

⭐ How is cₙ calculated?
c_n = final cell state after the last time step
This is the long-term memory and is computed using the LSTM formula:
c_t = f_t * c_(t-1) + i_t * g_t
Where:
f_t = forget gate
i_t = input gate
g_t = candidate new memory
c_(t-1) = previous cell state
Let’s break this into simple words:
✔ Step 1: Forget old memory
forget_gate * previous_cell_state
✔ Step 2: Add new important memory
input_gate * candidate_state
✔ Step 3: Combine to form new cell state
c_t = (things to keep) + (things to add)
This updated c_t becomes the next timestep’s c_(t-1).
At the final timestep:
c_n = last cell state (long-term memory)

⭐ Relationship between hₜ and cₜ
After computing c_t, the hidden state is calculated using the output gate:
h_t = output_gate * tanh(c_t)
So:
c_t = what LSTM stores
h_t = what LSTM outputs

📌 Simple Intuition
Memory Type.            Variable	            Meaning
Long-term memory	        cₙ          	What the LSTM keeps for a long time
Short-term output memory	hₙ	            What the LSTM uses right now

✔ Example in PyTorch Returning Values
If sequence length = 5, LSTM returns:
output → hidden states at all 5 steps
h_n    → hidden state at step 5 (final)
c_n    → cell state at step 5 (final)
So yes:
hₙ = recent short-term memory
cₙ = recent long-term memory
And c_n is ALWAYS calculated using:
forget gate + new info gate
