🌳 1. What is a Decision Tree? 
A Decision Tree is like playing 20 Questions:
Is it raining?
Is it cold?
Should I take an umbrella?
Every question splits the path.
Finally, you reach an answer.
In ML, Decision Tree asks “questions” on features to make a prediction.

🌳 2. Why is it called a Tree?
Because it starts from:
Root Node → first question
Branches → answers
Leaf Node → final prediction (class/number)
Just like a real tree upside-down.

🎯 3. Where Do We Use Decision Trees?
Decision Trees can do both:
✔ Classification
→ Predict YES/NO, spam/not spam, disease/no disease
Example: Is the email spam?
✔ Regression
→ Predict a number
Example: Predict house price based on area

🌳 4. Real-Life Example (Very Easy):
Imagine predicting whether a person will buy an iPhone 15.
A tree may ask:
💰 Is salary > 50,000?
👶 Age < 30?
📱 Do they like technology?
Each question filters the data, leading to a decision.

🌟 5. How does a Decision Tree decide questions?
It chooses the question that best splits the data.
It uses:
✔ Gini Impurity (common)
✔ Entropy (Information Gain)
✔ MSE (for regression) 

🧠 6. Gini Impurity – Explained Simple:
Gini measures how “mixed” the data is.
Pure group → Gini = 0
(example: all “Yes”)
Mixed group → higher Gini
(example: 50% Yes, 50% No)
The tree tries to reduce impurity after every split.

📈 7. Entropy & Information Gain (Simple):
Entropy = disorder
Information Gain = reduction in disorder
Tree chooses the question that reduces the most disorder.
Think of cleaning your room:
More clean → lower entropy
Less clean → higher entropy

🧩 8. Visualization:
Each node asks a question like:
Age > 30?
Income High?
Student?
Finally → answer: Yes / No

🏆 10. Advantages of Decision Trees:
✔ Easy to understand
✔ Works for classification & regression
✔ Requires no normalization
✔ Captures nonlinear patterns
✔ Good for small & medium datasets
✔ Can handle mixed data types (numerical + categorical)

⚠️ 11. Disadvantages:
❌ Overfits easily
(so we use pruning or Random Forest)
❌ Not stable (small change in data → different tree)
❌ Large trees become hard to interpret

✂️ 12. Tree Pruning (Important):
Pruning reduces overfitting by cutting unnecessary branches.
Parameters to control tree size:
max_depth
min_samples_split
min_samples_leaf
max_leaf_nodes
Example:
DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
