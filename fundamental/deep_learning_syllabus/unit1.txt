UNIT – 1 : INTRODUCTION (Deep Learning)

1. Introduction to Machine Learning
What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a method where a computer learns patterns from data instead of being manually programmed.
Simple Example:
Give many images of cats → ML learns the pattern → Predicts “cat” for new image.
Types of ML
Supervised Learning – Labeled data (e.g., spam / not spam).
Unsupervised Learning – No labels (e.g., clustering customers).
Reinforcement Learning – Learning by trial & reward (like playing games).

2. Linear Models
Linear models predict using a line/hyperplane:
𝑦=𝑤^𝑇*𝑥+𝑏
Where →
w = weights
b = bias
x = input features

2.1 Logistic Regression
Used for binary classification (Yes/No).
Key Idea:
Logistic Regression outputs probability using sigmoid:
𝜎(𝑧)=1/1+𝑒^−𝑧
Decision:
If probability > 0.5 → Class 1
Else → Class 0

2.2 Perceptron
The simplest neural network (1 neuron).
Working:
Take weighted sum:
𝑧=𝑤^𝑇𝑥+𝑏
Apply step function:
If z > 0 → 1
Else → 0
Perceptron Limitation:
Cannot solve non-linear problems (like XOR).

2.3 Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
SVM finds the best separating line (hyperplane) between two classes.
Goal:
Maximize margin (distance between line and nearest points).
Diagram (simple):
Class 1: o o o
               \   <-- decision boundary
Class 2: x x x
Important Terms
Support Vectors → Points closest to boundary
Kernel Trick → Converts non-linear data into linear form

3. INTRO TO NEURAL NETWORKS
3.1 What a Shallow Neural Network Computes
A shallow network = 1 hidden layer.
Diagram
Input → [Hidden Layer] → Output
Mathematical Form:
Hidden layer:h=σ(W1​x+b1​)
Output layer:y=σ(W2​h+b2​)
Neural nets learn weights that turn inputs → useful features → predictions.

4. TRAINING A NETWORK
Training = finding best weights using loss functions + backpropagation + SGD.

4.1 Loss Functions
Tell how “wrong” the model is.
Common Ones:
MSE (Mean Squared Error) → Regression
Cross-Entropy Loss → Classification

4.2 Backpropagation
Simple meaning:
Backprop tells each weight how much it contributed to the error and how to update it.
Steps (easy):
Do forward pass → get prediction
Compare with actual → compute loss
Send error backward → compute gradients
Update weights

4.3 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
SGD updates weights using:w=w−η⋅∂w/∂L​
Where:
η (eta) = learning rate
L = loss
gradient = direction of increasing error
SGD uses one sample at a time, making it fast.

5. Neural Networks as Universal Function Approximators
The Universal Approximation Theorem
A neural network with one hidden layer can approximate ANY continuous function.
Meaning →
Given enough neurons, a neural network can learn almost any pattern (image → label, audio → text, etc.).
