UNIT – 1 : INTRODUCTION (Deep Learning)

1. Introduction to Machine Learning
What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a method where a computer learns patterns from data instead of being manually programmed.
Simple Example:
Give many images of cats → ML learns the pattern → Predicts “cat” for new image.
Types of ML
Supervised Learning – Labeled data (e.g., spam / not spam).
Unsupervised Learning – No labels (e.g., clustering customers).
Reinforcement Learning – Learning by trial & reward (like playing games).

2. Linear Models
Linear models predict using a line/hyperplane:
𝑦=𝑤^𝑇*𝑥+𝑏
Where →
w = weights
b = bias
x = input features

2.1 Logistic Regression
Used for binary classification (Yes/No).
Key Idea:
Logistic Regression outputs probability using sigmoid:
𝜎(𝑧)=1/1+𝑒^−𝑧
Decision:
If probability > 0.5 → Class 1
Else → Class 0

2.2 Perceptron
The simplest neural network (1 neuron).
Working:
Take weighted sum:
𝑧=𝑤^𝑇𝑥+𝑏
Apply step function:
If z > 0 → 1
Else → 0
Perceptron Limitation:
Cannot solve non-linear problems (like XOR).

2.3 Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
SVM finds the best separating line (hyperplane) between two classes.
Goal:
Maximize margin (distance between line and nearest points).
Diagram (simple):
Class 1: o o o
               \   <-- decision boundary
Class 2: x x x
Important Terms
Support Vectors → Points closest to boundary
Kernel Trick → Converts non-linear data into linear form
