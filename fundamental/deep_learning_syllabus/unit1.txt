UNIT – 1 : INTRODUCTION (Deep Learning)

1. Introduction to Machine Learning
What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a method where a computer learns patterns from data instead of being manually programmed.
Simple Example:
Give many images of cats → ML learns the pattern → Predicts “cat” for new image.
Types of ML
Supervised Learning – Labeled data (e.g., spam / not spam).
Unsupervised Learning – No labels (e.g., clustering customers).
Reinforcement Learning – Learning by trial & reward (like playing games).

2. Linear Models
Linear models predict using a line/hyperplane:
𝑦=𝑤^𝑇*𝑥+𝑏
Where →
w = weights
b = bias
x = input features

2.1 Logistic Regression
Used for binary classification (Yes/No).
Key Idea:
Logistic Regression outputs probability using sigmoid:
𝜎(𝑧)=1/1+𝑒^−𝑧
Decision:
If probability > 0.5 → Class 1
Else → Class 0

2.2 Perceptron
The simplest neural network (1 neuron).
Working:
Take weighted sum:
𝑧=𝑤^𝑇𝑥+𝑏
Apply step function:
If z > 0 → 1
Else → 0
Perceptron Limitation:
Cannot solve non-linear problems (like XOR).

2.3 Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
SVM finds the best separating line (hyperplane) between two classes.
Goal:
Maximize margin (distance between line and nearest points).
Diagram (simple):
Class 1: o o o
               \   <-- decision boundary
Class 2: x x x
Important Terms
Support Vectors → Points closest to boundary
Kernel Trick → Converts non-linear data into linear form

3. INTRO TO NEURAL NETWORKS
3.1 What a Shallow Neural Network Computes
A shallow network = 1 hidden layer.
Diagram
Input → [Hidden Layer] → Output
Mathematical Form:
Hidden layer:h=σ(W1​x+b1​)
Output layer:y=σ(W2​h+b2​)
Neural nets learn weights that turn inputs → useful features → predictions.

4. TRAINING A NETWORK
Training = finding best weights using loss functions + backpropagation + SGD.

4.1 Loss Functions
Tell how “wrong” the model is.
Common Ones:
MSE (Mean Squared Error) → Regression
Cross-Entropy Loss → Classification

4.2 Backpropagation
Simple meaning:
Backprop tells each weight how much it contributed to the error and how to update it.
Steps (easy):
Do forward pass → get prediction
Compare with actual → compute loss
Send error backward → compute gradients
Update weights

4.3 Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
SGD updates weights using:w=w−η⋅∂w/∂L​
Where:
η (eta) = learning rate
L = loss
gradient = direction of increasing error
SGD uses one sample at a time, making it fast.

5. Neural Networks as Universal Function Approximators
The Universal Approximation Theorem
A neural network with one hidden layer can approximate ANY continuous function.
Meaning →
Given enough neurons, a neural network can learn almost any pattern (image → label, audio → text, etc.).

⭐ Perfect 8-Mark Answer Summary(SVM):
SVM is a classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane which separates classes with maximum margin.
The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points from each class.
These nearest points are called support vectors, and they completely determine the position of the hyperplane.
SVM selects the hyperplane that maximizes the margin because it improves generalization and reduces classification error.

Final Answer Summary (Write this in exam)
Backpropagation is a learning algorithm used to train neural networks by propagating the error backward from the output layer to the input layer. 
It uses the chain rule to compute gradients for each weight and bias. The algorithm consists of the following steps:
Forward pass: Compute the output of the network.
Loss calculation: Compare predicted output with actual output.
Output error computation: Calculate error at output layer.
Backward pass: Propagate error backward to all layers.
Gradient computation: Compute gradients of loss w.r.t weights and biases.
Weight update: Adjust weights using gradient descent or SGD.
This process repeats for many epochs until the loss becomes minimal.

⭐ 8. Short Answer (neural network):
Short 6–8 line answer:
A neural network is called a universal function approximator because a feed-forward network with at least one hidden layer
and a non-linear activation function can approximate any continuous function to any degree of accuracy. This is known as the 
Universal Approximation Theorem.The hidden layer neurons act as basic non-linear building blocks. By combining many neurons, 
the network can represent highly complex and non-linear relationships between input and output.
Therefore, neural networks can model almost any real-world problem such as classification, regression, speech, images, etc.

Short 5–mark version (shallow neural network):
A shallow neural network has one hidden layer between the input and output.
In the forward pass, inputs are multiplied with weights, biases are added, and activation functions are applied:
h=σ(W1​x+b1​)
y=ϕ(W2​h+b2​)
In training, backpropagation computes gradients of the loss and updates the weights using gradient descent.
The hidden layer enables the network to learn non-linear relationships, making shallow networks powerful function approximators.
