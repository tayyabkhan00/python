UNIT – 1 : INTRODUCTION (Deep Learning)

1. Introduction to Machine Learning
What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a method where a computer learns patterns from data instead of being manually programmed.
Simple Example:
Give many images of cats → ML learns the pattern → Predicts “cat” for new image.
Types of ML
Supervised Learning – Labeled data (e.g., spam / not spam).
Unsupervised Learning – No labels (e.g., clustering customers).
Reinforcement Learning – Learning by trial & reward (like playing games).
