Regularization :

Regularization is a technique used to stop a model from memorizing data and instead help it learn properly.
👉 Think of it like this:
A good student understands concepts
A bad student memorizes answers
Regularization makes the model a good student 👍
It adds rules or limits so the model does not become too complex.

What is Overfitting?
Overfitting happens when a model:
Learns the training data too well
But fails on new (unseen) data
📌 The model remembers noise and small details that are not actually important.

Real-Life Example
Imagine preparing for an exam:
You memorize past question papers → you score high on practice tests
In the real exam, questions change → you fail
👉 This is overfitting.

In Machine Learning Terms
Training accuracy → very high
Testing accuracy → low
This means the model has overfitted.

Why Overfitting is Bad
Model does not generalize
Performs poorly in real-world use
Gives false confidence

How Regularization Fixes Overfitting
Regularization controls the model’s freedom.
Common regularization methods (simple idea):
L1 / L2 Regularization → stop weights from becoming too large
Dropout → randomly turn off neurons so model can’t depend on only a few
Early Stopping → stop training before memorization starts
Data Augmentation → show more varied data
