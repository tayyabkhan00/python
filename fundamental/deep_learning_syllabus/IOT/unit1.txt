✅ 1. IoT Vision (Why IoT exists)
IoT’s vision =
“Connect everything (devices, vehicles, machines) to the internet to collect data, automate tasks and make life smarter.”
Example:
Smart home → fan turns on automatically based on temperature.

✅ 2. Definition of IoT (Write any 1 in exam)
IoT is a network of physical devices equipped with sensors, software, and connectivity that allow them to collect and 
exchange data over the Internet.
OR (short):
IoT = Devices + Sensors + Internet + Data + Automation

✅ 3. Conceptual Framework of IoT (Important)
Framework = how IoT works step-by-step:
Sensing (sensors collect raw data)
Communication (send data → WiFi, Bluetooth, LoRa, 5G)
Data Processing (cloud/edge computing analyzes data)
Action (actuators perform action)
User Interface (mobile app, dashboard)
Exam line:
“Conceptual framework explains the flow from sensing → communication → processing → action.”

✅ 4. Architectural View of IoT (Very important)
3-layer architecture (mostly asked):
Perception layer → sensors, actuators
Network layer → communication technologies
Application layer → smart home, healthcare, agriculture
5-layer architecture (sometimes asked):
Perception
Transport
Processing
Application
Business layer
Write any one if exam doesn’t specify.

✅ 5. Technology Behind IoT
These are core enabling technologies:
✔ Sensors & Actuators
Sensors collect data; actuators perform actions.
✔ Connectivity Technologies
WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRaWAN, NFC, 4G/5G.
✔ Cloud Computing
Stores and processes data (AWS IoT, Azure IoT).
✔ Edge Computing
Processes data near the device to reduce delay.
✔ Big Data & Analytics
Used to analyze IoT data.
✔ Embedded System
Microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi).

✅ 6. Sources of the IoT (Where IoT data comes from?)
People → wearables, smartphones
Things → machines, appliances
Environment → temperature, humidity
Vehicles → connected cars
Industrial machines → sensors in factories

✅ 7. M2M Communication (Important Theory Question)
M2M = Machine-to-Machine communication
→ machines send data to each other without human involvement.
Example:
Electric meter → sends reading automatically to power company.
Characteristics:
Automatic
Uses sensors
Uses wireless networks
Forms the base of IoT
IoT = M2M + Cloud + Applications

✅ 8. IoT Examples (Easy marks)
Smart home: smart lights, AC, security camera
Smart healthcare: heart rate monitor, smart pills
Smart agriculture: soil moisture sensors
Smart city: smart parking, smart street lights
Wearables: smart watch, fitness band

🟦 Design Principles for Connected Devices

✅ 9. IoT/M2M System Layers & Standardization
Layers (simple):
Device layer (sensors, actuators)
Communication layer (WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee)
Service layer (cloud services, APIs)
Application layer (user apps)
Standardization ensures devices from different companies can work together (interoperability).
Organizations:
IEEE
IETF
3GPP
OneM2M

✅ 10. Communication Technologies (High chance of exam question)
Short and easy:
Wi-Fi → high speed, home IoT
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) → wearables
ZigBee → home automation
LoRa / LoRaWAN → long range, low power
NFC → short range
4G/5G → wide-area IoT (cars, smart city)

✅ 11. Data Enrichment & Data Consolidation
✔ Data Enrichment
Adding extra context or meaning to raw sensor data.
Example: raw temperature → enriched with location & timestamp.
✔ Data Consolidation
Combining data from multiple sensors into one unified dataset.
Example: room temp + humidity + light → combined for smart home decision.

✅ 12. Ease of Designing & Affordability
IoT should be:
Low power
Low cost
Easy to install
Easy to scale
Easy to update
Use open-source platforms (Arduino, ESP32)
