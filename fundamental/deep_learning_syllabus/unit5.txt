Case Study and Applications

1. ImageNet
What is ImageNet?
ImageNet is a very large image dataset used to train and test deep learning models.
Contains 14+ million images
Images are divided into 1000 classes (dog, cat, car, etc.)
Why is ImageNet important?
Made deep learning popular
Used to train famous CNN models:
AlexNet
VGG
ResNet
Helps models learn features like edges, shapes, textures
Exam line:
👉 ImageNet is a large-scale labeled image dataset used to train and benchmark convolutional neural networks.

2. Detection (Object Detection)
What is Detection?
Detection means:
Finding objects
Locating them
Labeling them
Example:
Image → person, car, dog + bounding boxes

Difference:
Classification → What is in image?
Detection → What + Where?

Popular models:
R-CNN
Faster R-CNN
YOLO
SSD

Applications:
Self-driving cars
Surveillance
Face detection

3. Audio – WaveNet
What is WaveNet?
WaveNet is a deep learning model for audio generation.
Developed by Google DeepMind
What does it do?
Generates raw audio waveforms
Produces very natural human-like speech
Applications:
Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Voice assistants (Google Assistant)
Music generation
Key idea:
👉 Models audio sample-by-sample using deep neural networks.

4. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
What is NLP?
NLP allows machines to understand human language.
Tasks in NLP:
Text classification
Sentiment analysis
Translation
Chatbots
Deep learning models used:
RNN
LSTM
Transformers

5. Word2Vec
What is Word2Vec?
Word2Vec converts words into numbers (vectors) such that:
Similar words → Similar vectors
Example:
king - man + woman ≈ queen
Two architectures:
CBOW – Predict word from context
Skip-gram – Predict context from word
Why important?
Captures semantic meaning
Used in search engines, chatbots

6. Joint Detection
What is Joint Detection?
Detecting multiple things at the same time.
Examples:
Face + Emotion
Object + Action
Person + Pose
Why needed?
Real-world problems involve many tasks together
Improves accuracy using shared features
Application:
Autonomous driving
Surveillance systems

7. Bioinformatics
What is Bioinformatics?
Applying deep learning to biological and medical data.
Uses:
DNA sequence analysis
Protein structure prediction
Disease diagnosis
Examples:
Cancer detection from images
Drug discovery
Exam line:
👉 Deep learning helps in analyzing complex biological data efficiently.

8. Face Recognition
What is Face Recognition?
Identify or verify a person from an image
Steps:
Face detection
Feature extraction
Matching with database
Models used:
CNN
DeepFace
FaceNet
Applications:
Mobile phone unlock
Security systems
Attendance systems

9. Scene Understanding
What is Scene Understanding?
Understanding the entire image, not just objects.
Includes:
Object detection
Relationships
Context
Example:
“A person riding a bike on a road”
Used in:
Autonomous vehicles
Robotics
Smart cameras
