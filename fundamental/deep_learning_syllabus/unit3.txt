DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION & CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS

1. Dimensionality Reduction (Why & What?)
Dimensionality Reduction means reducing the number of input features without losing important information.
Why needed?
Reduces computation
Removes noise & redundancy
Avoids curse of dimensionality
Improves model performance & visualization

2. Linear Methods
(a) PCA – Principal Component Analysis
Type: Unsupervised
Goal: Maximize variance
Idea:
Converts correlated features → uncorrelated principal components
Keeps components with maximum variance
Steps (exam-friendly):
Standardize data
Compute covariance matrix
Find eigenvalues & eigenvectors
Select top-k eigenvectors
Key Points:
No class labels used
Used in data compression, visualization
Loses interpretability
📌 Example: Reducing 100 features → 10 important components

(b) LDA – Linear Discriminant Analysis
Type: Supervised
Goal: Maximize class separability
Idea:
Projects data so that different classes are far apart
Minimizes within-class variance
Key Points:
Uses class labels
Works well for classification
Number of components ≤ (classes − 1)
📌 PCA vs LDA (1-line exam)
PCA maximizes variance, LDA maximizes class separation.

3. Manifold Learning
Idea: High-dimensional data lies on a low-dimensional manifold.
Examples:
Isomap
LLE
t-SNE
UMAP
📌 Used for non-linear dimensionality reduction

4. Metric Learning
Goal: Learn a distance function instead of features.
Idea:
Similar points → closer
Dissimilar points → farther
Used in:
Face recognition
Recommendation systems
Clustering
📌 Example: Siamese Networks

5. Autoencoders (Neural Network Based DR)
What is an Autoencoder?
A neural network that learns to compress and reconstruct data.
Structure:
Encoder → Latent space → Decoder
📌 Latent space = reduced dimensional representation
Types:
Basic Autoencoder
Denoising Autoencoder
Sparse Autoencoder
Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
Advantages:
Non-linear DR
Learns complex patterns
Limitation:
Needs large data

6. Dimensionality Reduction in Deep Networks
CNNs reduce dimension via:
Pooling layers
Strided convolutions
Autoencoders used for:
Feature extraction
Pretraining

7. Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Why CNN instead of ANN?
Images have spatial structure
CNN preserves local patterns
Fewer parameters than ANN
Core Components:
Convolution Layer
Activation (ReLU)
Pooling Layer
Fully Connected Layer

8. CNN Architectures (Very Important)
(a) AlexNet (2012)
Key Features:
First deep CNN success
Used ReLU
Introduced Dropout
Won ImageNet 2012
📌 8 layers (5 conv + 3 FC)

(b) VGGNet
Key Features:
Uses 3×3 small filters
Very deep (16 / 19 layers)
Simple but heavy (large parameters)
📌 Good accuracy but slow & memory heavy

(c) Inception (GoogLeNet)
Key Idea:
Parallel filters (1×1, 3×3, 5×5)
Efficient computation
Uses 1×1 convolution for dimension reduction
📌 Smart & efficient architecture

(d) ResNet
Key Innovation: Skip / Residual Connections
Why important?
Solves vanishing gradient
Enables very deep networks (100+ layers)
📌 Residual formula:
Output = F(x) + x

9. Training a ConvNet
(a) Weight Initialization
Xavier Initialization
He Initialization (best for ReLU)
📌 Prevents vanishing/exploding gradients
(b) Batch Normalization
Purpose:
Normalize activations
Faster training
More stable gradients
📌 Applied after convolution & before activation

(c) Hyperparameter Optimization
Important hyperparameters:
Learning rate ⭐
Batch size
Number of layers
Optimizer (SGD, Adam)
Techniques:
Grid Search
Random Search
Bayesian Optimization

Ultra-Short Exam Summary (2–3 lines)

Dimensionality reduction reduces feature space while preserving information. PCA and LDA are linear techniques, 
autoencoders provide non-linear reduction. CNN architectures like AlexNet, VGG, Inception, and ResNet improve image 
learning using convolution, pooling, and residual connections.
