🎯 What is Logistic Regression?
Logistic Regression is an algorithm used when the output is YES/NO, 0/1, True/False.
It doesn’t predict numbers.
It predicts probability.
Examples:
Email spam? Yes / No
Tumor cancerous? Yes / No
Will customer buy? Yes / No
Will student pass? Yes / No

⭐ 1. Why is it called “Regression” if it predicts classes?
Because it uses a linear equation inside and then applies a curve.
Inside:
z = mX + b   (same like linear regression)
Then we apply sigmoid to convert it into probability:
p = 1 / (1 + e^-z)

⭐ 2. Sigmoid Function (Heart of Logistic Regression):
Sigmoid converts any number → 0 to 1.
If p > 0.5 → Predict 1 (YES)
If p < 0.5 → Predict 0 (NO)
Example:
If model gives p = 0.83 → 83% chance of “YES”.

Sometimes for complex data, boundary is:
Linear
Curved
Circular
Complex shapes

⭐ 3. Cost Function (Binary Cross Entropy)
Linear regression uses MSE.
But logistic regression uses:
Log Loss / Binary Cross Entropy
Because logistic output is probability.
Formula:
Loss = - [ y log(p) + (1 - y) log(1 - p) ]
Goal → minimize loss.

⭐ 4. Gradient Descent (Same idea as Linear Regression)
The algorithm updates weights:
w = w - learning_rate × dLoss/dw
b = b - learning_rate × dLoss/db
Don’t worry — sklearn handles it.

⭐ 5. Where is Logistic Regression used?

✔ Email spam filter
✔ Credit card fraud detection
✔ Disease prediction (Diabetes, Cancer)
✔ Customer churn prediction
✔ Social media likes prediction
✔ Pass/Fail prediction
✔ Survival prediction
✔ Bank loan approval
Whenever output = YES/NO, use Logistic Regression.

⭐ 6. Advantages
✔ Fast
✔ Simple
✔ Easy to interpret
✔ Works well on small datasets
✔ Used in industry everywhere

⭐ 7. Disadvantages
❌ Doesn’t work well with nonlinear data
❌ Assumes linearly separable classes
❌ Cannot handle too many features without regularization
