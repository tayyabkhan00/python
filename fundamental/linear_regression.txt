⭐ 1. What is Slope (m)?
Slope tells how fast y changes when x changes.
Simple school meaning:
If you walk up a hill:
Small slope → gentle hill
Large slope → steep hill
Negative slope → going downhill

Formula you learned:
m = rise / run = change in y / change in x
In Linear Regression:
We don’t have just 2 points…
We have many points.
So we use:
m = Σ[(x - mean_x)*(y - mean_y)] / Σ[(x - mean_x)^2]
This means:
If x increases, how much does y increase on average?
Example meaning:
If m = 1.2
→ Every time x increases by 1, y increases by 1.2.

⭐ 2. What is Intercept (c)?
Intercept is:
➡️ Where the line touches the y-axis
➡️ Value of y when x = 0
Formula:
c = mean_y - m * mean_x
Simple meaning:
If someone starts at x = 0, what is their starting y value?
Example:
If c = 2.5
→ When x = 0, y = 2.5

⭐ 3. What are Predictions (y_pred)?
Once you have slope (m) and intercept (c), the line equation is:
y = m*x + c
Linear regression basically draws the best-fitting straight line through your data.
Example:
If:
m = 1.2
c = 2
And you want to predict y for x = 4:
y = 1.2 * 4 + 2 = 6.8
So prediction means:
📌 Using the best-fitting line to guess the output.

⭐ 4. What is MSE (Mean Squared Error)?
After predicting, we want to check:
👉 How far are our predictions from real values?
👉 Lower MSE = Better model

Formula:
MSE = mean( (y - y_pred)² )
Break it down:
Difference (error):
y - y_pred
Square it (so negatives don’t cancel):
Take average of all squared errors.
Example:
If real y = [3, 5]
And predicted y = [2, 6]
Errors:
(3-2)² = 1
(5-6)² = 1
MSE:
(1 + 1) / 2 = 1

Meaning:
Lower MSE → Line fits the data well
Higher MSE → Line is far from the points

🎯 SUPER SIMPLE SUMMARY (Like School)
Concept	Simple Meaning	Linear Regression Meaning
Slope (m)	Steepness of line	How much y changes when x changes
Intercept (c)	Where line hits y-axis	y value when x = 0
Prediction (y_pred)	Using line to find y for any x	Model guess
MSE	Avg mistake	How bad the predictions are

🎯 R² Score (Coefficient of Determination):
R² tells how GOOD your line is.
👉 Simple Meaning
R² = How much the model explains the data
Value is between 0 and 1 (sometimes negative)

⭐ MSE vs R²:
| Metric  | Meaning                 | Goal               | Range  |
| ------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| **MSE** | Average squared error   | **Lower is good**  | 0 → ∞  |
| **R²**  | How well line fits data | **Higher is good** | -∞ → 1 |

⭐ Summary:
MSE = How wrong are predictions?
Lower = better
R² = How good is the line?
Higher = better
| R² Value | Meaning                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| **1.0**  | perfect model                     |
| **0.9**  | 90% of data explained             |
| **0.5**  | average                           |
| **0**    | model is useless                  |
| **< 0**  | model is worse than just guessing |

🎯 MSE — Mean Squared Error:
MSE tells you how WRONG your predictions are.
👉 Formula (very simple)
MSE = average of (prediction – actual)²
Why squared?
To make all errors positive
To punish big mistakes more
