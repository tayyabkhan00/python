Wireless Medium Access Issues in IoT

Wireless medium access in IoT faces challenges such as collision, hidden node problem, limited bandwidth, high energy 
consumption, scalability issues, and interference. Since IoT devices are battery-powered and deployed in large numbers, 
efficient medium access mechanisms are required. These issues are addressed using energy-efficient MAC protocols, 
time-slot scheduling, duty cycling, and collision avoidance techniques.

What is Wireless Medium Access?
In IoT, many sensor nodes share the same wireless channel (air).
Medium Access defines how nodes decide when to transmit data so that:
Data is not lost
Energy is saved
Network remains stable

1. Collision Problem
What is Collision?
When two or more nodes transmit at the same time, their signals overlap → data gets corrupted.

Why is collision serious in IoT?
Sensors have low power
Retransmission wastes battery
Reduces network lifetime
Example:
Node A and Node B send data simultaneously to Sink → ❌ both packets lost

Impact:
Increased delay
More energy consumption
Lower throughput

2. Hidden Node Problem 
What is Hidden Node?
Two nodes cannot hear each other, but both send data to the same receiver, causing collision.
Example:
Node A ----> Sink <---- Node C
(A and C cannot hear each other)

Why common in IoT?
Low transmission power
Short radio range
Dense sensor deployment

3. Exposed Node Problem
What is Exposed Node?
A node unnecessarily waits even though it could transmit safely.
Example:
Node B hears Node A transmitting
But B’s transmission wouldn’t cause collision
Still B waits → ❌ underutilization

4. Energy Consumption Issue (Most Critical in IoT)
Why energy is a big issue?
IoT sensors run on battery
Replacement is often impossible (forests, pipelines)

5. Scalability Issue
What is Scalability?
Ability to support thousands or millions of nodes

6. Bandwidth Limitation
Why limited bandwidth?
ISM bands are shared
Low data-rate radios used to save energy

7. Interference Issue
Sources of interference:
Wi-Fi
Bluetooth
Microwave ovens
Other IoT networks
Effect:
Signal distortion
Packet loss
Increased retransmissions

MAC Protocol Survey (Medium Access Control) in IoT

MAC protocols in IoT control access to the shared wireless medium to reduce collisions and save energy. Due to resource 
constraints, IoT MAC protocols emphasize low power consumption, scalability, and reliability. Contention-based protocols 
like CSMA offer flexibility but suffer from collisions, while schedule-based protocols like TDMA provide collision-free 
communication at the cost of synchronization overhead. Energy-efficient MAC protocols such as S-MAC and T-MAC introduce 
sleep–wake cycles to extend network lifetime. IEEE 802.15.4 is the most widely used MAC standard for IoT applications.

📡 Survey of Routing Protocols in IoT Networks

Routing protocols in IoT are used to efficiently transmit data from sensor nodes to the sink. Due to limited energy and 
resources, protocols are designed to minimize power consumption and improve scalability. Common routing protocols include 
data-centric, hierarchical, and location-based routing. Hierarchical protocols like LEACH are energy efficient, while 
data-centric protocols reduce redundancy. Proper routing increases network lifetime and reliability.

One node becomes CH
Member nodes send data to CH
CH aggregates data & sends to sink
🔸 Advantages:
