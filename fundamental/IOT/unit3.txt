Network & Communication Aspects in IoT

IoT devices (sensors, actuators) must communicate wirelessly with each other and with servers. This unit focuses on how 
data moves efficiently and reliably in IoT networks.

1. Wireless Medium Access Issues
In IoT, many small devices share the same wireless channel.
Key Issues:
1.Collision
Two nodes transmit at the same time → data lost
2.Limited bandwidth
Many devices, but small channel capacity
3.Energy constraint
Sensors run on battery → communication must save power
4.Scalability
Network should work with thousands of nodes
5.Hidden node problem
Two nodes can’t hear each other but collide at receiver
Goal:
👉 Efficient, low-power, collision-free communication

2. MAC Protocol Survey (Medium Access Control)
MAC decides who can transmit and when.

Types of MAC Protocols in IoT

(a) Contention-Based MAC
Example: CSMA/CA
Node listens before sending
Simple, flexible
❌ Collisions & energy waste
Used in: Wi-Fi, Zigbee

(b) Schedule-Based MAC
Example: TDMA
Time divided into slots
Each node gets a fixed slot
✅ No collision, energy efficient
❌ Needs synchronization
Used in: Industrial IoT

(c) Hybrid MAC
Combines CSMA + TDMA
Balance between flexibility and efficiency
Important MAC Protocols:
S-MAC → sleep/wake cycles (energy saving)
T-MAC → adaptive active time
IEEE 802.15.4 → base standard for Zigbee, 6LoWPAN

3. Survey of Routing Protocols
Routing = how data travels from sensor to sink (gateway)
Challenges:
Limited energy
Dynamic topology
Multi-hop communication
Types of Routing Protocols
(a) Data-Centric Routing
Example: Directed Diffusion
Based on data interest, not node address
Efficient for sensor data

(b) Hierarchical Routing
Example: LEACH
Nodes form clusters
Cluster head collects & sends data
✅ Saves energy
❌ Cluster head dies faster

(c) Geographic Routing
Example: GPSR
Uses node position (location)
Low overhead
Needs location info
Common IoT Routing Protocols:
RPL (IPv6 routing for low-power networks)
AODV-based protocols
LEACH

4. Sensor Deployment & Node Discovery
Sensor Deployment
How sensors are placed in the environment.
Types:
Deterministic deployment
Pre-planned (factories, smart buildings)
Random deployment
Dropped randomly (forests, disaster areas)
Node Discovery
Process by which nodes find neighbors and join the network.
Steps:
Node wakes up
Broadcasts discovery message
Nearby nodes reply
Routing tables updated
Challenges:
Energy usage
Dynamic nodes (sleep/wake)

5. Data Aggregation & Dissemination
Data Aggregation
Combining data from multiple sensors to reduce redundancy.
Example:
Temperature from 10 sensors → average value
✅ Benefits:
Reduces communication
Saves energy
Less network congestion
Aggregation Methods:
Tree-based
Cluster-based (LEACH)
Data Dissemination
How data is distributed to nodes or servers
Types:
Sink-based dissemination
Data sent to central server
Query-based dissemination
Sink asks for specific data
Event-based dissemination
Data sent only when event occurs
