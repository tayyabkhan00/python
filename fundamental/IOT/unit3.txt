Network & Communication Aspects in IoT

IoT devices (sensors, actuators) must communicate wirelessly with each other and with servers. This unit focuses on how 
data moves efficiently and reliably in IoT networks.

1. Wireless Medium Access Issues
In IoT, many small devices share the same wireless channel.
Key Issues:
1.Collision
Two nodes transmit at the same time → data lost
2.Limited bandwidth
Many devices, but small channel capacity
3.Energy constraint
Sensors run on battery → communication must save power
4.Scalability
Network should work with thousands of nodes
5.Hidden node problem
Two nodes can’t hear each other but collide at receiver
Goal:
👉 Efficient, low-power, collision-free communication

2. MAC Protocol Survey (Medium Access Control)
MAC decides who can transmit and when.

Types of MAC Protocols in IoT

(a) Contention-Based MAC
Example: CSMA/CA
Node listens before sending
Simple, flexible
❌ Collisions & energy waste
Used in: Wi-Fi, Zigbee

(b) Schedule-Based MAC
Example: TDMA
Time divided into slots
Each node gets a fixed slot
✅ No collision, energy efficient
❌ Needs synchronization
Used in: Industrial IoT

(c) Hybrid MAC
Combines CSMA + TDMA
Balance between flexibility and efficiency
Important MAC Protocols:
S-MAC → sleep/wake cycles (energy saving)
T-MAC → adaptive active time
IEEE 802.15.4 → base standard for Zigbee, 6LoWPAN

3. Survey of Routing Protocols
Routing = how data travels from sensor to sink (gateway)
Challenges:
Limited energy
Dynamic topology
Multi-hop communication
Types of Routing Protocols
(a) Data-Centric Routing
Example: Directed Diffusion
Based on data interest, not node address
Efficient for sensor data

(b) Hierarchical Routing
Example: LEACH
Nodes form clusters
Cluster head collects & sends data
✅ Saves energy
❌ Cluster head dies faster

(c) Geographic Routing
Example: GPSR
Uses node position (location)
Low overhead
Needs location info
Common IoT Routing Protocols:
RPL (IPv6 routing for low-power networks)
AODV-based protocols
LEACH

4. Sensor Deployment & Node Discovery
Sensor Deployment
How sensors are placed in the environment.
Types:
Deterministic deployment
Pre-planned (factories, smart buildings)
Random deployment
Dropped randomly (forests, disaster areas)
Node Discovery
Process by which nodes find neighbors and join the network.
Steps:
Node wakes up
Broadcasts discovery message
Nearby nodes reply
Routing tables updated
Challenges:
Energy usage
Dynamic nodes (sleep/wake)

5. Data Aggregation & Dissemination
Data Aggregation
Combining data from multiple sensors to reduce redundancy.
Example:
Temperature from 10 sensors → average value
✅ Benefits:
Reduces communication
Saves energy
Less network congestion
Aggregation Methods:
Tree-based
Cluster-based (LEACH)
Data Dissemination
How data is distributed to nodes or servers
Types:
Sink-based dissemination
Data sent to central server
Query-based dissemination
Sink asks for specific data
Event-based dissemination
Data sent only when event occurs

6. One-Line Exam Summary
Wireless medium access deals with channel sharing and energy efficiency

Routing protocols define paths from sensors to sink
Sensor deployment affects coverage and connectivity
Node discovery helps nodes join the network

Wireless Medium Access Issues in IoT

Wireless medium access in IoT faces challenges such as collision, hidden node problem, limited bandwidth, high energy 
consumption, scalability issues, and interference. Since IoT devices are battery-powered and deployed in large numbers, 
efficient medium access mechanisms are required. These issues are addressed using energy-efficient MAC protocols, 
time-slot scheduling, duty cycling, and collision avoidance techniques.

What is Wireless Medium Access?
In IoT, many sensor nodes share the same wireless channel (air).
Medium Access defines how nodes decide when to transmit data so that:
Data is not lost
Energy is saved
Network remains stable

1. Collision Problem
What is Collision?
When two or more nodes transmit at the same time, their signals overlap → data gets corrupted.

Why is collision serious in IoT?
Sensors have low power
Retransmission wastes battery
Reduces network lifetime
Example:
Node A and Node B send data simultaneously to Sink → ❌ both packets lost

Impact:
Increased delay
More energy consumption
Lower throughput

2. Hidden Node Problem 
What is Hidden Node?
Two nodes cannot hear each other, but both send data to the same receiver, causing collision.
Example:
Node A ----> Sink <---- Node C
(A and C cannot hear each other)

Why common in IoT?
Low transmission power
Short radio range
Dense sensor deployment

3. Exposed Node Problem
What is Exposed Node?
A node unnecessarily waits even though it could transmit safely.
Example:
Node B hears Node A transmitting
But B’s transmission wouldn’t cause collision
Still B waits → ❌ underutilization

4. Energy Consumption Issue (Most Critical in IoT)
Why energy is a big issue?
IoT sensors run on battery
Replacement is often impossible (forests, pipelines)

5. Scalability Issue
What is Scalability?
Ability to support thousands or millions of nodes

6. Bandwidth Limitation
Why limited bandwidth?
ISM bands are shared
Low data-rate radios used to save energy

7. Interference Issue
Sources of interference:
Wi-Fi
Bluetooth
Microwave ovens
Other IoT networks
Effect:
Signal distortion
Packet loss
Increased retransmissions

| Hidden Node  | Nodes can’t hear each other | Collision      | RTS/CTS          |
| Energy Drain | Idle listening              | Short lifetime | Sleep scheduling |
| Scalability  | Many nodes                  | Congestion     | Clustering       |
| Bandwidth    | Limited spectrum            | Delay          | Aggregation      |
| Interference | Shared spectrum             | Packet loss    | Channel hopping  |
