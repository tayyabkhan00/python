HARDWARE FOR IoT:

1️⃣ Sensors (Heart of IoT)

What is a Sensor?
A sensor is a device that detects physical or environmental changes and converts them into electrical signals.

Common Types of Sensors in IoT:
Temperature sensor → measures heat (LM35, DHT11)
Humidity sensor → measures moisture
Light sensor (LDR) → detects light intensity
Gas sensor → detects gases (MQ series)
Motion sensor (PIR) → detects movement
Pressure sensor → measures force/pressure

Why Sensors are Important?
They collect real-world data
Without sensors → IoT has no input

2️⃣ Digital Sensors

What are Digital Sensors?
Output data in digital form (0s and 1s)
Do not require ADC (Analog to Digital Converter)

Features
High accuracy
Less noise
Easy to interface with microcontrollers

Examples
DHT11 / DHT22 → temperature + humidity
Ultrasonic sensor → distance measurement
IR sensors

👉 Exam Tip:
Digital sensors are preferred in IoT due to accuracy and easy integration.

3️⃣ Actuators (Action Devices)

What is an Actuator?
An actuator converts electrical signals into physical action.
Examples
Motor → movement
Relay → switching devices ON/OFF
LED / Buzzer → indication
Servo motor → precise angle control

| Sensors           | Actuators          |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Input devices     | Output devices     |
| Sense environment | Act on environment |

4️⃣ RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)

What is RFID?
RFID uses radio waves to identify and track objects wirelessly.

Components
RFID Tag → attached to object
RFID Reader → reads tag data
Antenna → communication
Backend system → stores data

Types of RFID Tags
Passive → no battery (cheap, short range)
Active → battery powered (long range)

Applications
Smart cards
Attendance systems
Inventory management
Toll collection

5️⃣ Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)

What is WSN?
A network of sensor nodes that collect and transmit data wirelessly.

Components of WSN Node:
Sensor
Microcontroller
Radio module
Power source (battery)

Characteristics:
Low power consumption
Self-organizing
Scalable

Use Cases:
Environmental monitoring
Smart agriculture
Disaster detection

6️⃣ Participatory Sensing Technology
Meaning
Data is collected by people using their smart devices (phones, wearables).
Examples
Mobile GPS data for traffic apps
Health data from smartwatches
Noise level reporting apps
Key Idea
➡ Humans become data sensors
